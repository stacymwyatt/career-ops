# Mode: scan — Portal Scanner (Job Discovery)

Scans configured job portals, filters by title relevance, and adds new offers to the pipeline for later evaluation.

> **Note (v1.6+):** The default scanner (`scan.mjs` / `npm run scan`) is **zero-token** and uses structured sources: company-specific local parsers and public APIs from Greenhouse, Ashby, and Lever. The Playwright/WebSearch levels described below are the **agent** flow (run by Claude/Codex), not what `scan.mjs` does. If a company has no local parser or Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever API, `scan.mjs` will skip it; for those cases, the agent must manually complete Level 1 (Playwright) or Level 3 (WebSearch).
>
> **Rule (v1.8+):** If a company's local parser completes successfully at Level 0, the agent **must not** re-run that company via Playwright (Level 1) or API (Level 2). In Level 3, general queries remain active, but results from companies already covered by a parser are discarded. See [Rule: successful local parser](#rule-successful-local-parser--no-repeat-expensive-scraping).

## Recommended execution

Run as a subagent to avoid consuming main context:

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="[contents of this file + specific data]",
    run_in_background=True
)
```

## Configuration

Read `portals.yml` which contains:
- `search_queries`: List of WebSearch queries with `site:` filters per portal (broad discovery)
- `tracked_companies`: Specific companies with `careers_url` for direct navigation
- `tracked_companies[].parser`: Optional local parser for SSR or stable HTML pages
- `title_filter`: Positive/negative/seniority_boost keywords for title filtering

## Discovery strategy (4 levels)

### Level 0 — Local parser (CHEAPEST)

**For each company in `tracked_companies` with `parser:` configured:** run the local parser defined in `portals.yml`. This level is ideal when the careers page uses SSR or stable HTML and a JavaScript, Python, or other local runtime script already exists to extract jobs without agent assistance.

Recommended contract:

```yaml
- name: Example Company
  careers_url: https://example.com/careers
  scan_method: local_parser
  parser:
    command: node
    script: scripts/parsers/example-company-jobs.js
    format: jobs-json-v1
  enabled: true
```

Typically the parser is company-specific and already knows the URL, selectors, and pagination. `args` is optional: use it to help whoever built the script — for example to reuse it across companies, pass `{careers_url}` or `{company}`, enable a debug flag, save a JSON snapshot, or control any parser-specific behavior.

The parser must print JSON to stdout:

Array format:

```json
[
  { "title": "Senior AI Engineer", "url": "https://example.com/jobs/123", "location": "Remote" }
]
```

Object format with `jobs`:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    { "title": "Senior AI Engineer", "url": "https://example.com/jobs/123", "location": "Remote" }
  ]
}
```

Object format with `results`:

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "title": "Senior AI Engineer", "url": "https://example.com/jobs/123", "location": "Remote" }
  ]
}
```

`company` is optional; if absent, `scan.mjs` uses the name from `tracked_companies`.

The scanner does not need to retain the full JSON after reading stdout. If a parser also generates an artifact for auditing or debugging, save it to `data/parser-output/{company}/` and keep it out of git (JSON files in `.gitignore`; `.gitkeep` files stay in git to preserve the structure).

### Rule: successful local parser — no repeat expensive scraping

The goal of `scan_method: local_parser` is to **reduce tokens**: avoid having the LLM re-scrape the same company with Playwright or redundant APIs.

During the agent scan, maintain in memory the set **`local_parser_ok`**: company names (`tracked_companies[].name`) where Level 0 completed successfully:

- `parser.command` + `parser.script` exist and the script ran without a fatal error
- stdout was valid JSON (`[]`, `{ jobs: [] }`, or `{ results: [] }`)
- No timeout or process crash

| Level | If company is in `local_parser_ok` |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| **1 — Playwright** | **Skip** — no `browser_navigate` to its `careers_url` (most token-expensive method) |
| **2 — API** | **Skip** — no WebFetch of its `api:` (already covered by parser; `scan.mjs` also skips API after a successful parser) |
| **3 — WebSearch** | Run **general** queries (`site:`, role titles); **discard** each hit whose normalized company matches `local_parser_ok` |

**Exceptions:**

- Parser **failed** → company does **not** enter `local_parser_ok`; Levels 1 and 2 apply normally (same fallback logic as `scan.mjs` when a parser fails but an ATS API exists).
- Level 3: do not disable cross-cutting queries (`site:jobs.ashbyhq.com`, `site:boards.greenhouse.io`, etc.) — they are used to discover **new** companies. Only filter results from companies already in `tracked_companies` with a successful parser.
- Do not create dedicated `search_queries` entries for a company with an active local parser (e.g. `site:jobs.ashbyhq.com/cohere "AI Engineer"`); use the parser, or fall back to Playwright/API if it fails.

**Recommended Level 0:** run `node scan.mjs` (or `npm run scan`) at the start of the agent workflow. That covers all local parsers + APIs in a single zero-token step and reports which companies used `local-parser` successfully.

### Level 1 — Direct Playwright (PRIMARY)

**For each company in `tracked_companies` not in `local_parser_ok`:** Navigate to its `careers_url` with Playwright (`browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`), read ALL visible job listings, and extract the title + URL of each. This is the most reliable method because:
- It sees the page in real time (not cached Google results)
- It works with SPAs (Ashby, Lever, Workday)
- It detects new offers immediately
- It does not depend on Google indexing

**Each company MUST have `careers_url` in portals.yml.** If it is missing, find it once, save it, and use it in future scans.

### Level 2 — ATS APIs / Feeds (SUPPLEMENTARY)

For companies with a public API or structured feed **not in `local_parser_ok`**, use the JSON/XML response as a fast complement to Level 1. It is faster than Playwright and reduces visual scraping errors.

**Current support (variables in `{}`):**
- **Greenhouse**: `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company}/jobs`
- **Ashby**: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR**: list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; job detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Lever**: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor**: `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday**: `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**Parsing conventions by provider:**
- `greenhouse`: `jobs[]` → `title`, `absolute_url`
- `ashby`: GraphQL `ApiJobBoardWithTeams` with `organizationHostedJobsPageName={company}` → `jobBoard.jobPostings[]` (`title`, `id`; build public URL if not in payload)
- `bamboohr`: list `result[]` → `jobOpeningName`, `id`; build detail URL `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`; to read the full JD, GET the detail and use `result.jobOpening` (`jobOpeningName`, `description`, `datePosted`, `minimumExperience`, `compensation`, `jobOpeningShareUrl`)
- `lever`: root array `[]` → `text`, `hostedUrl` (fallback: `applyUrl`)
- `teamtailor`: RSS items → `title`, `link`
- `workday`: `jobPostings[]`/`jobPostings` (varies by tenant) → `title`, `externalPath` or URL built from host

### Level 3 — WebSearch queries (BROAD DISCOVERY)

The `search_queries` with `site:` filters cover portals broadly (all Ashby, all Greenhouse, etc.). Useful for discovering NEW companies not yet in `tracked_companies`, but results may be stale. After filtering hits from companies in `local_parser_ok`, the remaining results are deduplicated against Levels 0–2.

**Execution priority:**
1. Level 0: Local parser → companies with `parser:` configured and script present; build `local_parser_ok`
2. Level 1: Playwright → `tracked_companies` with `careers_url`, **except** `local_parser_ok`
3. Level 2: API → `tracked_companies` with `api:`, **except** `local_parser_ok`
4. Level 3: WebSearch → all `search_queries` with `enabled: true`; discard hits from companies in `local_parser_ok`

Levels are additive — run in order, results are merged and deduplicated. Companies in `local_parser_ok` **do not** go through Levels 1 or 2; in Level 3 they only contribute to cross-cutting discovery (other companies on the same portal).

## Workflow

1. **Read configuration**: `portals.yml`
2. **Read history**: `data/scan-history.tsv` → URLs already seen
3. **Read dedup sources**: `data/applications.md` + `data/pipeline.md`

3.5. **Level 0 — Local parser** (`scan.mjs`, zero-token):
   Initialize `local_parser_ok = []`.
   Prefer running `node scan.mjs` once to cover all parsers + APIs zero-token; if done manually, follow the logic below.
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true`, `parser.command` and script present:
   a. Run `parser.command` with `parser.script` + `parser.args` via local execution without shell
   b. Expand `{careers_url}` and `{company}` placeholders in arguments
   c. Read JSON from stdout (`[]`, `{ jobs: [] }`, or `{ results: [] }`)
   d. Normalize each job to `{title, url, company, location}`
   e. Resolve relative URLs against `careers_url`
   f. If the parser fails, log the error, attempt ATS API fallback if available, and continue with remaining companies (**do not** add to `local_parser_ok`)
   g. If the parser completes successfully (steps c–e without a fatal error), add `entry.name` to `local_parser_ok` and accumulate jobs in candidates

4. **Level 1 — Playwright scan** (parallel in batches of 3-5):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true`, `careers_url` defined, and **name not listed in `local_parser_ok`**:
   a. `browser_navigate` to the `careers_url`
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read all job listings
   c. If the page has filters/departments, navigate the relevant sections
   d. For each job listing extract: `{title, url, company}`
   e. If the page paginates results, navigate additional pages
   f. Accumulate in candidates list
   g. If `careers_url` fails (404, redirect), try `scan_query` as fallback and note the URL for updating

5. **Level 2 — ATS APIs / feeds** (parallel):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `api:` defined, `enabled: true`, and **name not listed in `local_parser_ok`**:
   a. WebFetch the API/feed URL
   b. If `api_provider` is defined, use its parser; if not defined, infer from domain (`boards-api.greenhouse.io`, `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, `api.lever.co`, `*.bamboohr.com`, `*.teamtailor.com`, `*.myworkdayjobs.com`)
   c. For **Ashby**, send POST with:
      - `operationName: ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
      - `variables.organizationHostedJobsPageName: {company}`
      - GraphQL query for `jobBoardWithTeams` + `jobPostings { id title locationName employmentType compensationTierSummary }`
   d. For **BambooHR**, the list returns only basic metadata. For each relevant item, read `id`, GET `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`, and extract the full JD from `result.jobOpening`. Use `jobOpeningShareUrl` as the public URL if present; otherwise use the detail URL.
   e. For **Workday**, send POST JSON with at least `{"appliedFacets":{},"limit":20,"offset":0,"searchText":""}` and paginate by `offset` until results are exhausted
   f. For each job extract and normalize: `{title, url, company}`
   g. Accumulate in candidates list (dedup against Level 1)

6. **Level 3 — WebSearch queries** (parallel where possible):
   For each query in `search_queries` with `enabled: true` (general portal/role queries — not dedicated queries for a company with an active local parser):
   a. Run WebSearch with the defined `query`
   b. From each result extract: `{title, url, company}`
      - **title**: from the result title (before " @ " or " | ")
      - **url**: result URL
      - **company**: after " @ " in the title, or extracted from domain/path
   c. **Discard** the result if `company` (normalized) matches any name in `local_parser_ok`
   d. Accumulate the rest in candidates list (dedup against Levels 0+1+2)

6. **Filter by title** using `title_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - At least 1 keyword from `positive` must appear in the title (case-insensitive)
   - 0 keywords from `negative` must appear
   - `seniority_boost` keywords give priority but are not required

6b. **Filter by location (optional)** using `location_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - If the `location_filter` block is absent, all locations pass (default behavior)
   - Empty location string on a job → pass (don't penalize missing data)
   - Any `block` keyword present → reject (takes precedence over allow)
   - Empty `allow` → pass (already cleared block)
   - Non-empty `allow` → must match at least one keyword
   - All matches are case-insensitive substring
   - Location is persisted as the 7th column in `scan-history.tsv` for later auditing

7. **Deduplicate** against 3 sources:
   - `scan-history.tsv` → exact URL already seen
   - `applications.md` → normalized company + role already evaluated
   - `pipeline.md` → exact URL already pending or processed

7.5. **Verify liveness of WebSearch results (Level 3)** — BEFORE adding to pipeline:

   WebSearch results may be stale (Google caches results for weeks or months). To avoid evaluating expired offers, verify with Playwright each new URL from Level 3. Levels 1 and 2 are inherently real-time and do not require this check.

   For each new Level 3 URL (sequential — NEVER Playwright in parallel):
   a. `browser_navigate` to the URL
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read the content
   c. Classify:
      - **Active**: job title visible + role description + visible Apply/Submit control within the main content. Do not count generic header/navbar/footer text.
      - **Expired** (any of these signals):
        - Final URL contains `?error=true` (Greenhouse redirects this way when a posting is closed)
        - Page contains: "job no longer available" / "no longer open" / "position has been filled" / "this job has expired" / "page not found"
        - Only navbar and footer visible, no JD content (content < ~300 chars)
   d. If expired: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_expired` and discard
   e. If active: continue to step 8

   **Do not abort the entire scan if one URL fails.** If `browser_navigate` errors (timeout, 403, etc.), mark as `skipped_expired` and continue with the next.

8. **For each new verified offer that passes filters**:
   a. Add to `pipeline.md` "Pending" section: `- [ ] {url} | {company} | {title}`
   b. Record in `scan-history.tsv`: `{url}\t{date}\t{query_name}\t{title}\t{company}\tadded`

9. **Title-filtered offers**: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_title`
10. **Duplicate offers**: record with status `skipped_dup`
11. **Expired offers (Level 3)**: record with status `skipped_expired`

## Extracting title and company from WebSearch results

WebSearch results come in format: `"Job Title @ Company"` or `"Job Title | Company"` or `"Job Title — Company"`.

Extraction patterns by portal:
- **Ashby**: `"Senior AI PM (Remote) @ EverAI"` → title: `Senior AI PM`, company: `EverAI`
- **Greenhouse**: `"AI Engineer at Anthropic"` → title: `AI Engineer`, company: `Anthropic`
- **Lever**: `"Product Manager - AI @ Temporal"` → title: `Product Manager - AI`, company: `Temporal`

Generic regex: `(.+?)(?:\s*[@|—–-]\s*|\s+at\s+)(.+?)$`

## Private URLs

If a URL is not publicly accessible:
1. Save the JD to `jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md`
2. Add to pipeline.md as: `- [ ] local:jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md | {company} | {title}`

## Scan History

`data/scan-history.tsv` tracks ALL URLs seen:

```
url	first_seen	portal	title	company	status
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	PM AI	Acme	added
https://...	2026-02-10	Greenhouse — SA	Junior Dev	BigCo	skipped_title
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	SA AI	OldCo	skipped_dup
https://...	2026-02-10	WebSearch — AI PM	PM AI	ClosedCo	skipped_expired
```

## Managing careers_url

Each company in `tracked_companies` must have `careers_url` — the direct URL to their job listings page. This avoids searching for it every time.

**RULE: Always use the company's own corporate URL; fall back to the ATS endpoint only if no corporate careers page exists.**

The `careers_url` should point to the company's own careers page whenever available. Many companies use Workday, Greenhouse, or Lever underneath, but expose job IDs only through their corporate domain. Using the ATS URL directly when a corporate page exists can cause false 410 errors because the job IDs don't match.

| ✅ Correct (corporate) | ❌ Incorrect as first choice (direct ATS) |
|---|---|
| `https://careers.mastercard.com` | `https://mastercard.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com` |
| `https://openai.com/careers` | `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/openai` |
| `https://stripe.com/jobs` | `https://jobs.lever.co/stripe` |

Fallback: if you only have the ATS URL, first navigate to the company's website and locate its corporate careers page. Use the direct ATS URL only if the company has no corporate careers page.

**Known patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`
- **Greenhouse:** `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}` or `https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/{slug}`
- **Lever:** `https://jobs.lever.co/{slug}`
- **BambooHR:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Teamtailor:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs`
- **Workday:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}`
- **Custom:** The company's own URL (e.g. `https://openai.com/careers`)

**API/feed patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby API:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR API:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail` (`result.jobOpening`)
- **Lever API:** `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor RSS:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday API:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**If `careers_url` does not exist** for a company:
1. Try the known platform pattern
2. If that fails, do a quick WebSearch: `"{company}" careers jobs`
3. Navigate with Playwright to confirm it works
4. **Save the found URL to portals.yml** for future scans

**If `careers_url` returns 404 or redirects:**
1. Note it in the scan output summary
2. Try `scan_query` as fallback
3. Flag for manual update

## portals.yml Maintenance

- **ALWAYS save `careers_url`** when adding a new company
- Add new queries as new portals or interesting roles are discovered
- Disable queries with `enabled: false` if they generate too much noise
- Adjust filtering keywords as target roles evolve
- Add companies to `tracked_companies` when you want to follow them closely
- Periodically verify `careers_url` — companies change ATS platforms
